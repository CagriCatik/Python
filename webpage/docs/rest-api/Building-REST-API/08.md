# Interacting with REST APIs and Python

In this tutorial, we will focus on how to interact with REST APIs using Python. This involves making HTTP requests to APIs and handling the responses. Weâ€™ll use the `requests` library, a popular Python library for making HTTP requests, to demonstrate how to interact with APIs effectively.

## Overview

We will cover:
- Setting up the `requests` library
- Making basic HTTP requests (GET, POST)
- Handling responses
- Managing query parameters and headers
- Handling errors and exceptions

## Step 1: Setting Up the `requests` Library

### Install `requests`

First, you need to install the `requests` library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Making Basic HTTP Requests

### Making a GET Request

A GET request is used to retrieve data from a specified resource.

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint
url = 'https://api.example.com/items'

# Make the GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the status code
print(f'Status Code: {response.status_code}')

# Print the response content
print(f'Response Content: {response.json()}')
```

### Making a POST Request

A POST request is used to send data to the server to create a new resource.

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint
url = 'https://api.example.com/items'

# Define the data to be sent
data = {
    'name': 'NewItem',
    'price': 20.0
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

# Print the status code
print(f'Status Code: {response.status_code}')

# Print the response content
print(f'Response Content: {response.json()}')
```

## Step 3: Handling Responses

### Response Status Codes

You can check the status code of the response to determine the outcome of the request.

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Request was successful.')
elif response.status_code == 201:
    print('Resource created successfully.')
else:
    print('An error occurred.')
```

### Parsing JSON Responses

Use the `.json()` method to parse JSON responses:

```python
data = response.json()
print(f'Item Name: {data["name"]}')
print(f'Item Price: {data["price"]}')
```

### Response Headers

Access response headers to get additional information about the response.

```python
headers = response.headers
print(f'Content-Type: {headers["Content-Type"]}')
```

## Step 4: Managing Query Parameters and Headers

### Adding Query Parameters

Include query parameters in your GET requests using the `params` argument.

```python
params = {'q': 'search_term', 'limit': 10}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
```

### Adding Headers

Add custom headers to your requests using the `headers` argument.

```python
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

### Example: Combining Query Parameters and Headers

```python
params = {'q': 'search_term', 'limit': 10}
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'}
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
```

## Step 5: Handling Errors and Exceptions

### Handling HTTP Errors

Check for HTTP errors and handle them gracefully.

```python
try:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx and 5xx)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f'HTTP error occurred: {http_err}')
except Exception as err:
    print(f'Other error occurred: {err}')
else:
    print('Success!')
```

### Handling Timeout

Specify a timeout to prevent your request from hanging indefinitely.

```python
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)  # Timeout after 5 seconds
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print('The request timed out.')
```

### Handling Connection Errors

Handle connection-related errors, such as network issues.

```python
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError

try:
    response = requests.get(url)
except ConnectionError:
    print('There was a problem connecting to the API.')
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to interact with REST APIs using Python and the `requests` library. We explored making GET and POST requests, handling responses, managing query parameters and headers, and handling errors and exceptions. Mastering these techniques will enable you to efficiently work with APIs and integrate them into your Python applications.

In the next tutorial, we will look into advanced usage of the `requests` library and explore how to handle more complex API interactions. Stay tuned!
