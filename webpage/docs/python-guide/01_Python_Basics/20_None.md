# None Type

The `None` type in Python is a special data type used to represent the absence of a value or the concept of nothing. It is often returned by certain functions to indicate that no meaningful value is available. 

## Basics of None Type

In its simplest form, the `None` type is a value that signifies the absence of any meaningful data.

```python
# Creating a variable with None value
no_value = None

# Printing the value and type of the variable
print(no_value)  # Output: None
print(type(no_value))  # Output: <class 'NoneType'>
```

## Example with Dictionaries

One common use case for the `None` type is when working with dictionaries. The `get` method of dictionaries allows us to retrieve a value for a given key, and if the key doesn't exist, it returns `None` instead of raising an exception.

```python
# Example with a dictionary of users
users = {1: 'Mario', 2: 'Luigi'}

# Trying to get a user with a non-existent key
user = users.get(3)
print(user)  # Output: None
```

## Optional Values

The `None` type is often used in defining optional values, indicating that a variable may or may not have a value.

```python
# Example of an optional value
possible_user: str or None = users.get(3)
print(possible_user)  # Output: None (if key doesn't exist) or a string (if key exists)
```

In this example, `possible_user` is declared as a string or `None` type, and it can hold either a string or `None` value, depending on the result of the `get` method. These are just basic examples, and you will encounter the `None` type frequently throughout your Python journey. It plays a crucial role in handling cases where the absence of a value needs to be explicitly represented.
