# Truthy and Falsy Values

In Python, every object can be categorized as either truthy or falsy. While the most explicit examples are the `True` and `False` booleans, it's important to note that these booleans are essentially constants representing 1 and 0, respectively. You can use any non-zero number as truthy and zero as falsy. For instance, using 1 instead of `True` and 0 instead of `False` is completely valid.

```python
# Using 1 as truthy and 0 as falsy
truthy_value = 1
falsy_value = 0
```

To determine the truthiness or falsiness of a value in Python, you can use the boolean type with parentheses.

```python
# Checking the truthiness or falsiness of values
empty_list = []
is_empty_list_truthy = bool(empty_list)  # Evaluates to False

none_value = None
is_none_truthy = bool(none_value)  # Evaluates to False

non_empty_value = 200
is_non_empty_truthy = bool(non_empty_value)  # Evaluates to True
```

### Examples

Consider different scenarios where truthy and falsy values play a crucial role in boolean checks.

```python
# Example: Checking if users exist before performing an operation
users = {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 22}

if users:
    for name, age in users.items():
        print(f"{name}: {age}")
else:
    print("No data found")
```

In this example, the code checks if the `users` dictionary is truthy before iterating over its items. If `users` is empty, set to `None`, or any other falsy value, it prints "No data found."

```python
# Example: Checking truthiness of different data types
empty_dict = {}
empty_string = ''
non_empty_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(bool(empty_dict))       # Evaluates to False
print(bool(empty_string))     # Evaluates to False
print(bool(non_empty_list))   # Evaluates to True
```

Here, you can observe how empty dictionary and string are considered falsy, while a non-empty list is truthy. Understanding truthy and falsy values is essential for effective boolean checks in Python, especially when dealing with conditions based on the existence or emptiness of data.
