# Mypy Static Type Checker 

In this tutorial, we'll explore the benefits of using Mypy, a powerful static type checker for Python. While code editors can catch some mistakes when annotating object types, Mypy ensures a more comprehensive check of types, especially in complex scenarios.

## Installation

To get started with Mypy, install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Once installed, you'll immediately notice syntax highlighting in your code editor, providing warnings for incompatible types.

## Usage in Code Editors

While some code editors may not display Mypy warnings by default, you can enhance your development environment by installing the Mypy plugin. Here's a quick guide for PyCharm users:

1. Navigate to **Settings**.
2. Go to **Plugins**.
3. Search for "Mypy" in the marketplace.
4. Install the plugin (choose the one with more downloads and better ratings).

## Running Mypy

To ensure a thorough check of your code, run Mypy from the command line:

```bash
mypy your_script.py
```

This command will identify any type mismatches and provide detailed warnings.

### Example: List Type Check

Consider a list variable defined to contain strings:

```python
my_list = ["cup", "apple"]
```

Mypy will catch issues if you attempt to insert incompatible types like booleans or other lists containing integers.

### Example: Optional Arguments

Mypy is especially helpful in catching errors related to optional arguments in functions. For instance:

```python
def my_function(default: int = None):
    # Your function logic here
```

Mypy will warn that the default value has the type of `None`, but the argument is annotated as `int`. To resolve this, either provide a default value that is not `None` or explicitly annotate the argument as `Optional`.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating a static type checker like Mypy into your projects is crucial for ensuring type correctness. While code editors can be helpful, Mypy provides an extra layer of validation, catching errors that may be overlooked. Regularly running the `mypy` command helps maintain code quality by detecting and fixing type-related issues early in the development process.
