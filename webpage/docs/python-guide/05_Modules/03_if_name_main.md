# `if __name__ == "__main__"`

The `if __name__ == "__main__"` construct in Python is used to execute a specific block of code only if the script is run directly. It helps in distinguishing whether the Python script is being run as the main program or being imported as a module in another script.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of using `if __name__ == "__main__"` is two-fold:

1. **Preventing Unintended Execution**: When a Python script is imported as a module into another script, it may contain executable code outside of function definitions. Placing such code within the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block ensures that it will only execute when the script is run directly, preventing unintended execution when imported as a module.
2. **Providing a Main Entry Point**: By placing the main functionality of a script within the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, it explicitly indicates the entry point for execution. This improves code readability and helps other developers understand which part of the script is meant to be executed independently.

### Example

Consider the following example script `connections.py`:

```python
import time

def connect():
    """Simulate connecting to the internet."""
    print("Connecting to internet...")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Connected!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    connect()
```

In this script, the `connect()` function is defined, and it is called within the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block. This ensures that `connect()` will only execute when `connections.py` is run directly.

## Running the Script

To run the script directly, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python connections.py
```

This will execute the `connect()` function and simulate connecting to the internet.

## Conclusion

Using `if __name__ == "__main__"` is a good practice in Python scripting as it provides clarity on the intended execution flow of the script. By incorporating this construct, developers can ensure that their scripts behave as expected when run directly or imported as modules into other scripts.
