## Getting Started

The companion website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator that simplifies content management and deployment.

### Features
- **Interactive Guides**: Follow along with the tutorials hosted on the site.
- **Community Contributions**: Engage with contributors and provide feedback.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Access content seamlessly from any device.

### Installation

To set up the website locally, ensure you have `yarn` installed, then run:

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

To preview and develop the website locally:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This will launch a local development server and open the website in your default browser. Changes you make to the files will reflect live without needing a server restart.

### Build

To generate static content for deployment:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

The static files will be stored in the `build` directory and can be hosted on any static content hosting service.
