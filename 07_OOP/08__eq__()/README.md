# Comparing Objects in Python: The `__eq__()` Dunder Method

In this tutorial, we will explore the `__eq__()` dunder method in Python, which allows us to define custom comparison logic for objects. By default, when comparing objects, Python checks for equality based on their memory addresses. However, in some cases, we may want to compare objects based on their attributes rather than their memory addresses.

Let's dive into an example using a `Car` class. The goal is to compare two cars based on their attributes, such as brand, car ID, and color.

## Implementation

```python
from typing import Type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand: str, car_id: int, color: str) -> None:
        self.brand = brand
        self.car_id = car_id
        self.color = color

    def __eq__(self, other: Type["Car"]) -> bool:
        # Customize the comparison logic here
        return self.car_id == other.car_id
```

In the above code:

- We define a `Car` class with an initializer that takes brand, car ID, and color as parameters.
- The `__eq__()` method is implemented to compare two cars based on their `car_id`.

## Example Usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create two cars
    car1 = Car("BMW", 1, "red")
    car2 = Car("BMW", 1, "red")

    # Check if the cars are equal
    result = car1 == car2

    # Display the result
    print(f"Are car1 and car2 equal? {result}")
```

In the example usage:

- We create two car objects with the same brand, car ID, and color.
- The `__eq__()` method compares the cars based on their `car_id`.
- The result is `True` because the car objects have the same car ID.

## Customizing the Comparison Logic

If you want to compare all attributes of the `Car` class, you can modify the `__eq__()` method to check the equality of all attributes:

```python
def __eq__(self, other: Type["Car"]) -> bool:
    return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
```

This approach compares all attributes using the dictionaries of the objects.

Feel free to experiment and customize the `__eq__()` method based on your specific requirements.

Happy coding!
