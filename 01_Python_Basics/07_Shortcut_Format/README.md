# Code Formatting Shortcut for Beautiful Python Code

Have you ever found yourself typing Python code in a hurry, only to realize later that it looks messy and lacks proper formatting? Well, fear not! This README introduces a handy shortcut to quickly format your code and make it more readable.

## The Problem

Consider the following poorly formatted Python code snippet:

```python
def example_function():
     print( "Hello, world!" )
   print( "Code formatting is important." )
```

While this code would run without any issues, it doesn't look clean and can be hard to read.

## The Solution

To effortlessly format your code into a more aesthetically pleasing style, we can use a convenient shortcut. In the example below, the shortcut is `Option + Command + L` on my computer, but you can customize it to your liking.

```python
def example_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
    print("Code formatting is important.")
```

## How to Set Up the Shortcut

1. If the default shortcut doesn't work for you, navigate to the settings and find the Keymap section.
2. Search for "reformat code."
3. Customize the shortcut to your preference or check the existing shortcut.
4. Click "OK" to save your changes.
