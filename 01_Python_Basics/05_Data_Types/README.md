# Python Data Types Overview

In Python, data types are crucial for defining the nature of values, allowing logical operations with compatible values. This README provides an overview of the most common data types in Python along with code snippets and examples.

## Numeric Types

### Integer

An integer represents any whole number, positive or negative.

```python
my_integer = 10
```

### Float

A float represents any decimal number.

```python
my_float = 5.5
```

### Imaginary

Imaginary numbers are represented with `j` in Python.

```python
my_imaginary = 2j
```

## Boolean Types

Boolean types represent two states: True or False.

```python
is_connected = True
has_money = False
```

## String Types

Strings represent textual data and can be written in single or double quotes.

```python
my_string = "Hello, Bob"
```

## Sequence Types

### List

A list is a mutable sequence type.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Tuple

A tuple is an immutable sequence type.

```python
coordinates = (2.5, 1.0)
```

## Mapping Types

### Dictionary

A dictionary is a mapping type that uses key-value pairs.

```python
users = {"Mario": 1, "Luigi": 2}
```

## Set Types

### Set

A set is an unordered collection without duplicate elements.

```python
my_set = {10, 25, 50}
```

### Frozen Set

A frozen set is an immutable version of a set.

```python
frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
```

Feel free to explore each data type in more detail as you progress through the course. Understanding these basics will be essential for comfortable Python programming.
